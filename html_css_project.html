            The human psyche is one hell of a tricky concept. Though you would
            think that as the totality of the human mind, we might try and
            understand it a little better – after all, it helps us navigate our
            lives. So, while the interior structure is of course as complicated
            as you might expect, I have recently taken it upon myself to try and
            comprehend the inner workings. Personally, this was more to gain a
            better understanding of myself and my own mind’s structure as the
            more thorough elements are quite individualised.

                Carl Jung’s Four Major Archetypes
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            Everyone’s mind works differently and due to this topic’s meticulous
            intensity, I praise anyone who takes this as a subject of academic
            study or as a career prospect. However, for a beginner like myself
            who’s simply striving for self-improvement, you might wonder where
            to even begin? For an introduction, I was recommended Dr. Murray
            Stein’s analysis of a long-standing psychoanalytical theory created
            by Carl Jung. As an expert in Jungian theory, Stein wrote the book
            “Jung’s Map of the Soul” that provides a straightforward coherency
            and empirical underpinning of Jung’s work with the self. Stein
            condenses 18 volumes of collected works into an accessible read for
            beginners in psychology and while there are many other
            psychoanalysts on this subject, Jung’s work is consistent yet
            adaptable. It doesn’t trap you into a specific understanding and is
            open to any interpretation. It’s possibly the best place to start in
            my opinion, especially through Stein’s comprehension.

              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            Overall, the most fundamental feature of Jung’s thinking was the
            Self. It’s the dynamic individuation of his research that separates
            his work from that of other psychoanalysts. He thought of the self
            as a cosmic entity that needs a human to recognise and understand it
            so that it may successfully reincarnate into a three-dimensional
            world. He believed that we are here to give a soul its temporary
            home and while this conclusion may seem airy to some, I found it
            quite comforting to believe in a purpose like this. Jung firmly
            believed that we all have a role to play in this universe, and he
            explains such through astrology, alchemy, theology, and other
            systems that do make this rather difficult to follow at times.
            Instead, Stein explains this in a way that avoids all the
            complicated branches and using Jung’s own concept to describe his
            understanding of who we are, he explains how we might fulfill our
            potential to become all that we can be. Furthermore, despite what
            you make think of Jung’s concept of the self, Stein uses Jung’s
            concrete research and evidence in breaking down the inner workings
            of our mind and explains them in a way that is consistent and
            comprehendible to those just starting out. While I would love to
            attempt painting the full picture of the map Jung created, I’ll
            instead brief you on just three parts that make up the solar system
            in our minds.

            <h4>The Ego</h4>
            As the primary center of the consciousness, the ego arranges
            everything in order of priority. It manipulates how you see the
            world for the purpose of survival and gives you the mental and
            physical energy required to do something. Essentially, it can be
            identified as your free will. Although Jung and Stein like to debate
            just how much free will we actually have when facing the instincts
            that lie buried in our unconscious minds. Nevertheless, the ego
            develops through ‘collisions’ which are emotional and physical
            happenings. Our egos are a constellation of complexes formed by our
            trauma and experiences but are adjusted by the exposure to the wider
            culture, almost like a frozen memory. However, it lacks control when
            a complex is triggered. For example, when someone metaphorically
            pushes your buttons, this is a literal happening in the mind and
            depending on how strong your ego is, you are overcome with an
            instant reaction that you may find incontrollable. This kind of
            research makes you wonder is there really such a thing as the
            ‘rational being’ or are some of us just better at controlling the
            external self?
          </article>

          <article>
            <h4>The Persona</h4>
            Then the persona is at the front of our consciousness, our ‘public
            person’. It helps us adapt to the demands of life and manage stable
            relations with the surrounding social world that is projected at the
            front of our consciousness. For a lot a people this aspect is
            functional to which they can turn on or off depending on the
            situation – those at work may not be the same at home. The two
            sources of content come from the expectations and demands of society
            that are then combined with the aspirations of the individual. The
            persona is who we become as a consequence of having to adapt to both
            physical and social environments. It’s how we let people see
            ourselves. Contextually, the term derives from the Latin word for
            “actors mask”, and its job is to conceal the individual thoughts and
            feelings we have that might not fit societal standards. It’s
            employed to make casual interaction much easier. According to Stein,
            a lot of actresses and actors are deeply introverted but enjoy
            playing the extrovert in their persona.

            <h4>The Shadow</h4>
            However, while the ego welcomes the persona, it rejects the shadow.
            When one is born, a person’s personality begins a simple unity but
            as one grows these parts split and our personality makes up a
            cluster of subpersonalities. Our human nature instinctively rebels
            against societal standards, and we are constantly in a great moral
            conflict as we continue to hide the parts of ourselves that we
            believe people won’t accept. Those rejected personalities fall into
            the shadow: the image of ourselves that we keep in the dark. Often
            this part of the human psyche goes against society’s beliefs and
            contains the more immoral thoughts. However, in pressing times the
            ego may utilise the shadow to carry out the unsavoury operations
            that it cannot perform because of the moral conflict. It’s a part of
            the unconscious that is not directly experienced by the ego but when
            a person is tremendously irritated by something or someone, their
            reaction is usually a signal of the shadow. Furthermore, this
            unconscious structure is a complementary opposite to the persona.
            Though Jung solely believes that if we were to integrate the shadow
            and persona, we may find self-acceptance. It’s a counter-persona but
            a person must open up to both sides of the psyche in order to
            fulfill the sense of wholeness that every human instinct desires. If
            a person completely shuns the shadow, life would be proper but
            terribly incomplete. Opening the shadow attains a greater degree of
            wholeness. If anyone truly is perfect then scientifically speaking,
            there is no way they are entirely happy being so. Therefore, if
            there was one thing that I took away from this book, it’s Jung’s
            belief that the self-ties all these factors together and creates the
            balance among the various other factors and ties them together into
            a functioning unity.

          <article>
            However, this is just the bare minimum in Jung’s work and I’ve only
            covered a small snippet of Stein’s complete understandings.
            Additionally, not all events of our lives can be covered by theory
            and the human psyche is made up of so many parts and structures with
            multiple perspectives. That being said, I believe “Map of the Soul”
            is the perfect entry to the sector. It made me realise that we take
            far too much credit for the genius and beauty of the mind and that
            we too often jump to conclusions that someone is the way they are
            solely because of childhood trauma. While that may in fact be
            probable, it does not cover the full scope of possible causes.
            Nonetheless, “Map of the Soul” was completely out of my reading
            depth and yet I took away a lot more than I ever thought I would.
